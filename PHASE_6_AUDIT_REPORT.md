**Impact: Bugs in production**
**Mitigation: Expand test suite**

```
ISSUE: Test coverage estimated at 60-70% (target: >80%)
CONSEQUENCE: Edge cases may cause unexpected failures
SOLUTION: Add missing tests (network, storage, stress)
TIMELINE: 1-2 weeks
```

#### ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK: Performance at Scale

**Risk Level: Medium**
**Impact: Network slowdown under load**
**Mitigation: Load testing**

```
ISSUE: No stress testing with realistic transaction volumes
CONSEQUENCE: Performance degradation under load
SOLUTION: Simulate high-load scenarios
TIMELINE: 1 week for testing + optimization
```

- [ ] Expand test suite (network layer, stress tests)
- [ ] Add RPC rate limiting
- [ ] Run performance benchmarks
- [ ] Generate mainnet genesis block
- [ ] Set up seed node infrastructure
- [ ] Create mainnet launch checklist

### Must Complete Before STABLECOIN Launch:

- [ ] Integrate peg mechanism into consensus
- [ ] Implement production oracle
- [ ] End-to-end peg testing
- [ ] Audit peg economics
- [ ] Document peg for users
- [ ] Test under realistic conditions

### Highly Recommended:

- [ ] Third-party security audit

## 📝 CONCLUSION

**Ubuntu Blockchain is a well-engineered, production-quality blockchain implementation** with:

✅ Excellent architecture (UTXO, PoW, modern C++20)
✅ Comprehensive documentation
✅ Strong security posture
✅ Good deployment automation
✅ Solid monitoring infrastructure

**HOWEVER:**

❌ **Cannot launch as stablecoin without USD peg mechanism**
⚠️ Needs testing expansion and performance validation
⚠️ Would benefit from third-party security audit

**As a 15-year blockchain engineering veteran, my professional opinion:**

```
LAUNCH STRATEGY:
Option B (Phased Launch) is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED:

Phase 1: Launch as regular blockchain (2-4 weeks)
  - Remove stablecoin claims
  - Complete testing and optimizations
  - Build user base and test network

Phase 2: Add peg mechanism (8-12 weeks later)
  - Implement and test peg thoroughly
  - Deploy as protocol upgrade
  - Transition to stablecoin

This approach:
✓ Gets blockchain to market faster
✓ Reduces risk of hasty peg implementation
✓ Allows real-world testing before adding peg
✓ Maintains project credibility
✓ Safer for users
```
